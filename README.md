# Overview

As a college student and an aspiring software engineer I found that I haven't spent much time on learning new software that is interesting to me. My goal for this project was to learn something new from something I've never done before. I have never made an app before or used React Native, so that is what I chose to do for this project.

The original idea for this app was to provide information about different crocheting stiches. The information being, how to do the stich, what it looks like, and websites to find more info on the stich. This app is still a work in progress on that idea.

For now the app displays a homescreen that has a login and registration button. The buttons work, but don't take you to another screen yet. There is another screen that is currently being built and will be accessed through the homescreen.

To use the app you must have an IOS phone and download the Expo Go app (or you can use the simulator from xcode). In the terminal enter npm start and once it's start press i to start the app on the phone. From the phone you should see the app start up.

(The app had some trouble loading so if you would like to skip 3:32-4:18 you will get through demo much faster.)

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop the code for this app as well as Expo to manage and easily display the app in a simulator.

I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS as the programming languages for this app. For the platform I used React Native because it creates Android and IOS compatible apps.

# Future Work

- Navigate to the different screens
- Have the user login or register
- Display different crocheting stiches and information about them
- Store the stiches and information in a database
- Make the app android usable
